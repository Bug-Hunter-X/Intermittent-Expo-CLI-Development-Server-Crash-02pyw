# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes intermittently without providing clear error messages in the terminal.  The application continues to function on the device/simulator but stops updating, displaying a blank screen or an outdated version.

## Bug Reproduction

The exact cause of the crash is difficult to pinpoint; it occurs inconsistently.

## Potential Causes (Speculative)

* **Memory leaks:** The development server may be susceptible to memory leaks over prolonged usage.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Unhandled asynchronous operations or race conditions might lead to crashes.
* **Expo CLI version incompatibility:** Potential conflicts with other installed packages or Node.js versions.

## Solution (If Found)

See `expoBugSolution.js` for a potential solution if one is discovered.  This may include updating dependencies, improving error handling, or using additional debugging tools.
