While the exact cause of the intermittent crashes is hard to reproduce consistently, a potential mitigation strategy focuses on rigorous error handling and monitoring resource usage.  For instance, adding more comprehensive error handling throughout the application may help catch potential issues leading to the server crash.  Additionally, incorporating tools like the Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler could help identify memory leaks. 

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// Example of improved error handling:

function myAsyncFunction() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // ... Asynchronous operations ...
    try {
      // ... Code that may throw errors ...
      resolve(result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in myAsyncFunction:", error);
      reject(error); // Explicitly reject on error 
    }
  });
}
```

Moreover, keeping the Expo CLI and related packages updated to their latest stable versions is crucial.  Checking the Expo documentation and community forums for known issues or relevant updates might provide further solutions.
