While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error messages in the terminal.  The app would function correctly on the device/simulator for a period, then abruptly stop updating, showing a blank screen or an older version of the app. This happened inconsistently; sometimes after minutes, other times after hours of development.  I tried restarting the server, clearing the cache, and even reinstalling Expo CLI, with no success. The problem only appeared in development; building to a standalone APK functioned correctly.
